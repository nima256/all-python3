# while loop
# while loop is very bigger than for loop
# when you give condition to while untill it will true it keep working
# but the for loop give same chance to user 
# for example in range you write 10 and user only have 10 chance to say number or every thing you want
# how write while loop?
# we write while and after that write condition and write ":" and give it

# space and write something that when the condition is not true write what

# example
# here i write a input that give number
a = int(input("eneter a number......."))
# and while and condition that when "a" it was not equal 
while a !=10:
    # write it is not true again
    a = int(input("it is not true again..."))
# when the condition is true it show nothing in output
