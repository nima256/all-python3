# what is variable
# a variable is something you can save something in it
# if the amounts is word you have to take it in "" double quotation 
# if the amounts is number you should not take double quotation

name = "nima"
# in here for last name we can not use space   we have to use _ or evey thing that you want
last_name = "mahdi"

# for print that we just have to print name of the variable
print(age)
