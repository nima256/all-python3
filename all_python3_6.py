# hello here we want to talk about dictionary
# how to creat dictionary
# first we have to enter a name for it and creat variable
# second we write dictionary with "{}" this
# third we have to enter name of our dictionary and enter a dictionart
# e.g
dic = {'name' : 'nima' , 'lstname' : 'mahdi' , 'age' : '15'}
print(dic)
# output == {'name': 'nima', 'lstname': 'mahdi', 'age': '15'}


# also we can print dictionary that we want 
# e.g
dic2 = {'name' : 'nima' , 'lstname' : 'mahdi' , 'age' : '15'}
# in print after write variable name and when we open [] this.. 
# ..systen automatic enter dictionary key name and you can choose it  
print(dic['lstname'])

# dictionary is easy to learn
# so and this script is short


# thanks for reading (:
