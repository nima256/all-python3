# hello
# i hope you are good 
# here i want to talk about something simple

# every string it's defult a list
# how? 
# let's see it

# here we write list
list = [234 , 24 , 43, 34 , 64]
# when we write "print(list[2])" it give us third thing in list 
print(list[2])
# output == 43
# it's simple

# here but it is string but we can also do "print(list[2])" this for string
# we creat cariable and in it there is a string
string = 'nima'
# here we do this 
print(string[1])
# and now 
# output == i
