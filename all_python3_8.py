# hello 
# i hoe you are good 
# here i want to talk about "def"

# what is def?
# def is command that you writ every thing you want in it and.... 
# ...at the end if you want to run it you  have to call def name
# for example this def name is a
# for run it you just have to write def name for example ==> python0()

def python0():
    print("hello world")

# in this def when you want to print it you must to write a something..
#.. in the braces 
# in your print you can use thing that user write
# for run this def you have to do this ==> python1('nima')
def python1(a):
    print(f'my name is {a}')

# in this def when you want to print it you must to write two something..
# .. or how many times do you want
# here i use \n and \t what are this?
# \n takes you 
# to next line 
# \t give tab   to your print 
def python2(a , b):
    print(f'my name is {a} \nand  \tmy age is {b} ')

# in this def we want to return def
# what is return?
# return dose not print for you it saved for you
# if you want to print it you have to saved your def in the variable
def python3(a , b):
    c = a+b
    return c 
test = python3(2 , 3)
print(test)

# i hope it will help you (:
